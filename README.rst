Introduction
================================================================================

**pyexcel-cli** brings `pyexcel <https://github.com/pyexcel/pyexcel>`_ to make it easy
to consume/produce information stored in excel files on command line interface.
This library can turn the excel data into a list of lists, a list of records(dictionaries),
dictionaries of lists. And vice versa. Hence it lets you focus on data in shell
programming, instead of file formats.

Hightlighted features:

#. View data in the excel files without Microsoft Office or Open Office
#. Transcode data among supported excel file formats
#. Merge files in various excel file formats into one
#. Split a multi-sheet excel file into single sheet files
#. Find difference in data between two excel files

Usage
================================================================================

.. code-block:: bash

   $ cd demo
   $ pyexcel view --in-browser --output-file-type sortable.html --sheet-index 0 https://github.com/pyexcel/excel2table/raw/master/sample/goog.ods

Here's what you will get:

.. note::

   You will need to install pyexcel-sortable, which renders it.

Here is another cli example usage:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pyexcel view https://github.com/pyexcel/pyexcel-cli/blob/master/tests/fixtures/multiple-sheets.xls
    Sheet 1:
    +---+---+---+
    | 1 | 2 | 3 |
    +---+---+---+
    | 4 | 5 | 6 |
    +---+---+---+
    | 7 | 8 | 9 |
    +---+---+---+
    Sheet 2:
    +---+---+---+
    | X | Y | Z |
    +---+---+---+
    | 1 | 2 | 3 |
    +---+---+---+
    | 4 | 5 | 6 |
    +---+---+---+
    Sheet 3:
    +---+---+---+
    | O | P | Q |
    +---+---+---+
    | 3 | 2 | 1 |
    +---+---+---+
    | 4 | 3 | 2 |
    +---+---+---+

Because pyexcel family is loosely coupled, especially for file format supports, you
install the libraries that you need to. If you need to support xls format, you will
need to install pyexcel-xls. For more information, please see the plugin section.

In order to manage the list of plugins installed, you need to use pip to add or remove
a plugin. When you use virtualenv, you can have different plugins per virtual
environment. In the situation where you have multiple plugins that does the same thing
in your environment, you need to tell pyexcel which plugin to use per function call.
For example, pyexcel-ods and pyexcel-odsr, and you want to get_array to use pyexcel-odsr.
You need to append get_array(..., library='pyexcel-odsr').

Installation
================================================================================

You can install pyexcel-cli via pip:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install pyexcel-cli


or clone it and install it:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ git clone https://github.com/pyexcel/pyexcel-cli.git

    $ python setup.py install



Development guide
================================================================================

Development steps for code changes

#. git clone https://github.com/pyexcel/pyexcel-cli.git
#. cd pyexcel-cli

Upgrade your setup tools and pip. They are needed for development and testing only:

#. pip install --upgrade setuptools pip

Then install relevant development requirements:

#. pip install -r rnd_requirements.txt # if such a file exists
#. pip install -r requirements.txt
#. pip install -r tests/requirements.txt

Once you have finished your changes, please provide test case(s), relevant documentation
and update CHANGELOG.rst.

.. note::

    As to rnd_requirements.txt, usually, it is created when a dependent
    library is not released. Once the dependecy is installed
    (will be released), the future
    version of the dependency in the requirements.txt will be valid.


How to test your contribution
------------------------------

Although `nose` and `doctest` are both used in code testing, it is adviable that unit tests are put in tests. `doctest` is incorporated only to make sure the code examples in documentation remain valid across different development releases.

On Linux/Unix systems, please launch your tests like this::

    $ make

On Windows systems, please issue this command::

    > test.bat

How to update test environment and update documentation
---------------------------------------------------------

Additional steps are required:

#. pip install moban
#. make your changes in `.moban.d` directory, then issue command `moban`

What is pyexcel-commons
---------------------------------

Many information that are shared across pyexcel projects, such as: this developer guide, license info, etc. are stored in `pyexcel-commons` project.

What is .moban.d
---------------------------------

`.moban.d` stores the specific meta data for the library.
